### Explain use cases of callback functions versus regular functions
### Explain how to capture web page events and user actions and respond to them using callback functions
### Use callback functions to filter, sort, and map arrays and objects in JavaScript
### Use string manipulation functions
### Discuss use of callback functions and asynchronous programming
###
