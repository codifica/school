### Types of variables in JS:
#### String
#### Number - passed by value, makes new copy 
#### Object [sub type Array] - reference, doesn't have to be returned in the function, not a copy
#### Boolean

Arrays are like Ender chests. The contents can be changed, but all the Ender chests for one player point to the same inventory slots.

> function subtractNumbers(num1, num2) { 
>   let result = num1-num2; 
>   console.log(result);
> };
> 
> subtractNumbers(10, 3) 

The function is declared first, and it takes 2 parameters, num1 and num2. Inside the function, the parameters num1 and num2 are passed in, and the block-scoped variable result is assigned the value of the remainder of num1 minus num2. It then prints that answer to the console log. So, when subtractNumbers(10, 3) is called, 3 is subtracted from 10, and the function returns as 7.

this reminds me of solving for x in algebra.
