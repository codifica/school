### I was very interested to read this discussion function expressions (defining a function as a variable) vs function declarations (declaring a function as a function). The author mentioned that they are cleaning up code from a previous developer, and wanted to know the differences between these two methods. From what I understand, it has to do with when code that enters that code block is executed? I look forward to understanding that better as we learn more.
